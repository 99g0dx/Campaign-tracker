Fix the UI layout of the Shared Campaign (View Only) page so the information is easier to understand at a glance, especially the “Posts” section.

Goals

* Improve visual hierarchy and spacing so users understand: campaign info → KPIs → time-window breakdown → trend chart → posts table.
* Make “Posts” readable like a real table with clear column headers (right now metrics show with icons but no labels).

Required layout changes

1. Page structure and hierarchy

* Add a clear header area at the top that shows:

  * Campaign name (lovn - SIMB edit campaign)
  * Track name (Sorry i'm Busy by Lovn)
  * A small “View Only” label/badge
* Keep the four KPI cards (Total Views, Total Likes, Comments, Shares) but ensure consistent sizing, spacing, and alignment.

2. Engagement Breakdown by Time Period

* Keep the time window buttons (Last 24 Hours, 72 Hours, 7 Days, 30 Days, 60 Days, 90 Days) but:

  * Visually indicate which one is selected (active state).
  * Make the selected window’s metrics (Views, Likes, Comments, Shares) appear directly under the buttons in a clean grid.
  * Add a small label like “Selected window totals” so users know these numbers are for the chosen time window.

3. Engagement Over Time chart section

* Keep the chart but improve readability:

  * Add consistent padding/margins around the chart container.
  * Keep the legend clear and aligned.
  * Ensure this section does not visually compete with the Posts section.

4. Posts section must become a labeled table
   Replace the current list-style rows with a proper table layout that includes a header row labeling each column.

* Add a header row with these columns:

  * Platform
  * Status
  * Creator
  * Post Link
  * Views
  * Likes
  * Comments
  * Shares (if shares are available per post; if not available, omit the column or show “—” consistently)
* Each post row should align perfectly under these headers.
* Right-align all numeric metric columns (Views, Likes, Comments, Shares).
* Use tabular/monospace number styling (tabular-nums) so values like 38.8K, 5.3K align cleanly.
* Keep platform and status as compact badges (TikTok/Instagram, Active/Pending).
* Make Post Link truncated with ellipsis but still clickable, and include the external-link icon.
* Add hover state on row (subtle background change) to improve scanability.
* Make the table responsive:

  * Desktop: full table with columns.
  * Mobile: convert each row into a stacked card with labels (Platform, Status, Creator, Link, Views, Likes, Comments, Shares).

5. Optional but recommended (improves comprehension)

* Add a small toolbar above Posts:

  * Search input: “Search creator or link”
  * Filter dropdowns or chips for Platform and Status
  * Sort dropdown: “Sort by Views (desc)” (sorting logic can be simple, but the UI should exist)

Deliverable

* Update the React UI components and Tailwind styling to implement the above, keeping the existing data and functionality intact.
* Do not change the page’s purpose (view-only shared campaign). Only improve layout, labeling, and readability.
